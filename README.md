# K_and_R-Second-Edition
Exercises from the famous "The C Programming Language" - Second Edition.

Going to try (as much as in my interest) to complete all of the exercises. My interest is in game engine development and the elements of C which
will be useful in that area. C++ would be the obvious starting point - however, a lot of source code written in C++ by game programmers seem to have a 
"C like" look to it
