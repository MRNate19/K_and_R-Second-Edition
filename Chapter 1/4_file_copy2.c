/* Exercise 1-7. Write a program to print the value
    of EOF */

/**********************************************************************
 *
 * You could probably do much better than I have done here and write  *
 * a program using putchar() and getchar() to activate an EOF;        *
 * however, the author has only asked for us to print the value of    *
 * EOF.                                                               *
